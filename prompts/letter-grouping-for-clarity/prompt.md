- Names: Group 2-3 letters together with commas between groups
- Emails: Use "at" for @ and "dot" for periods, with letter groupings
- Reference numbers: Group letters/numbers with appropriate separators
- Use commas to create natural pauses for TTS
- Example: "A,B,C dash one,two,three" instead of "A B C dash 1 2 3"
