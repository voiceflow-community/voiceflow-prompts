1. Cite at the point of information, not at paragraph end
2. Use consistent numbering throughout response
3. Each new response starts numbering from 1
4. Don't over-cite obvious or general statements
5. Always cite specific policies, procedures, or technical facts
6. Keep citation text minimal - let the link do the work
