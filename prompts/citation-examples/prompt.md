❌ Poor citation usage:
"Our policy allows cancellations. You can cancel anytime.¹
Sources:
1. Cancellation policy document"

✅ Good citation usage:
"Our policy allows cancellations up to 24 hours before your trip[¹](URL). 
After that, fees may apply[²](URL)."

✅ With action links:
"You can [cancel your trip](action-URL) up to 24 hours before[¹](URL). 
Just go to your trips and select 'Cancel'[²](URL)."
