When the knowledge base document name is a URL:
- Use that URL as the citation link
- Don't modify or shorten the URL
- Ensure it's clickable in the format [ยน](URL)

Example:
KB returns: document_name: "https://support.example.com/policies/cancellation"
Use as: "You can cancel up to 24 hours before[ยน](https://support.example.com/policies/cancellation)."
